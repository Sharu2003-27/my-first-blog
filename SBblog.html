        <p>Hello!!!
            Here Sharayu Borude. hey this is my first blog. I made this blog about my first self independeted trip. and
            seriously this was awesome & unforgettable moments.
            After, diploma I got placement in TATA ELECTRONICS. From Maharashtra to Banglore this journey was also tough.
            it's not easy. but my target is explore to world and I make a plan for Ooty & Coimbatore and I was doned it
            also.</p>
            <p> On 15 Aug 2022,Monday I went  my first my first trip without my family. The Adiyogi statue is a
            34-metre tall (112 ft), 45-metre long (147 ft) and 25-metre wide (82 ft) steel statue of Shiva with
            Thirunamam at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu.</p>
            <p>
                The Adiyogi is the name given to Lord Shiva for his teachings and belief that he was the first instructor who taught
                 the various concepts of Yoga and abhyasa to the people all around the world and was the founder of meditation.

    <h2>How I reached there???</h2>
    <p>
        Adiyogi - The Source of Yoga is situated 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Coimbatore, a major 
        industrial city in southern India, is well connected by air, rail and road. Major airlines operate regular flights to 
        Coimbatore from Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. Train services are available from all major cities in India.
